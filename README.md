# Project-Simulating-Hanoi-Tower CMPT 103 MacEwan University

I begin this project by seperating objects that is constant, and objects that will be alter.
After that I use assets from lab 5 to help with creating objects that will not be alter later on.
Then when the ui displayed element similar to the spec, I started to work on functions of each objects.
Starting with the changing displayed info, then button and posts since they both act in a similar manner.

milestone 2 and 3: most of the function name did not follow the spec is naming convention. The auto move function came from
the in class example of hanoi move.
